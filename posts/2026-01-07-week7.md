title: Working with the Date API
---

Today:

* Intro to the Date API
* Javascripting: working with time

## Night / day site

The goal is to make a site that changes based on whether it's day or night.


Let's start by making a button

```
<div class='pagecontent'>
  <button>click me</button>
</div>
```

If we click the button, it doesn't yet do anything. Let's give some instruction.

Add a color class.

```
.black {
  background-color: black;
}
```

Now let's hook up our Javascript:


```
function displayTime(){
  let currentTime = new Date();
  let hours currentTime.getHours();
  let minutes = currentTime.getMinutes();
  let seconds = currentTime.getSeconds();
}
```

Let's display this info

```
//grab our clock element
let clockDiv = document.getElementById('clock');

//set the text in the div

clockDiv.innerText = hours + ":" + minutes + ":" + seconds;
```

So our Javascript now looks like this:

```
$(document).ready( function() {

  function displayTime() {
    let currentTime = new Date();
    let hours = currentTime.getHours();
    let minutes = currentTime.getMinutes();
    let seconds = currentTime.getSeconds();

    // This gets a "handle" to the clock div in our HTML
    let clockDiv = document.getElementById('clock');

    // Then we set the text inside the clock div 
    // to the hours, minutes, and seconds of the current time
    clockDiv.innerText = hours + ":" + minutes + ":" + seconds;
  }

  // This runs the displayTime function the first time
  displayTime();

});
```

Now we'll make it visible.

```
<body>
   <div id='clock'></div>
</body>
```

We should now see the clock.

Let's make it look good.

```
body {
    background-color: #80d4ea;
}

#clock {
    height: 100px;
    width: 800px;
    margin: auto;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0; left: 0; bottom: 0; right: 0;
    padding-top: 70px;
    font-family: courier, monospace;
    text-align: center;
    color: white;
    font-size: 100px;
}
```

So far, the clock is just presenting the time at page load. But then nothing after that. Let's make it advance every second.

```
setInterval(displayTime, 1000);
```


### Challenge: How to fix the display

1. Digits 1-9 just show one digit. How do we fix that?
2. How do we show AM or PM?

## Assignment - Build a Better Clock

- Follow the [tutorial](https://googlecreativelab.github.io/coder-projects/projects/digital_clock/) to build a clock. The tutorial gets you going, but it produces a pretty basic clock. When you complete the tutorial, modify and create new CSS and change the Javascript. Make it better, more beautiful, easy to read, more interesting or even a vastly different clock. (For example, if you wanted to change the clock, you could countdown a presidency, create a clock for a new country with its own timezone, create a clock that updates once a decade, a clock that shows images instead of the time, etc)
- Bonus points for making your clock responsive so that it looks good on your phone and/or digital watch!

#### Examples of other alternative clocks

For this assignment, you are welcome to stick with and build off this counting digital clock approach. The following are clocks that count in a more 'analog' style.

- [Human Clock](https://www.humanclock.com/) - features a photo of a different person every minute holding up the time
- A basic clock in [Binary](https://binary.onlineclock.net/)!
- My own version of a [Season Clock](http://leetusman.com/everyday/9/) that rotates once a year.
- [Polar Clock](http://blog.pixelbreaker.com/polarclock) - written in Flash
- [Worldometer](http://www.worldometers.info/) - not a clock but clock-like
- an [online implementation](https://jayasurian123.github.io/berlin-uhr/) of Berlin's famous [Mengenlehreuhr clock](https://www.futilitycloset.com/2017/01/17/the-mengenlehreuhr/)

### Homework:

Build your own custom clock. Due in three weeks.

This is a project to use the Date() API in the browser to flex your muscle with HTML, CSS and JS to build a web application. You can choose what you want to make with this framework, but make it unique. Show us your creative take.

Examples:

* a world clock showing multiple time zones at once
* a countdown clock til death (sorry!) (or analog clock that shows the phases you'll have in life)
* a digital cuckoo clock
* Adding in images
* Build an experimental advent calendar

This project is due in 3 weeks, on the 27th.

This project will be evaluated by:

* Concept and originality 
* Code quality
* Design and Functionality
