            <p>Application Program Interface</p>
            <p>An API gives a list of commands that programmers can use
            to access functionality that they themselves haven’t coded
            or even necessarily know how they work but can still access
            and get the data they need.</p>
            <p>APIs control access to resources such as data.</p>
            <p>They are used to communicate between disparate
            services.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>An interface for different pieces of software to
            communicate together over networks</li>
            <li>These are created by organizations, programmers, and
            companies to access their data</li>
            <li>There are open APIs and those requiring
            authorization.</li>
            <li>start out by using APIs that have tutorials or sample
            code and consider trying out ones that don’t require
            authorization as you learn how to use them!</li>

            <h3 id="purchase-weather-api">Purchase Weather API</h3>
            <p>This is a stripped-down minimal example of getting
            started using the weather.gov API.</p>
            <p>Our class at <a href="https://purchase.edu">Purchase
            College</a> is located in the <em>coterminous
            town-village</em> of Harrison, NY.</p>
            <h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>
            <h3 id="index.html">index.html</h3>
            <p>Our index.html file holds the minimal-ist bit of text
            with a div that has the ID <code>the-forecast</code>.</p>
            <p>In our header we are importing jQuery to make it easier
            to import json date. This isn’t the only or necessarily the
            best way to import JSON, but it is consistent and easy to
            use.</p>
            <h3 id="style.css">style.css</h3>
            <p>A nod to style. This is currently minimally functional.
            Make it compelling, stylish, organized and intuitive.</p>
            <h3 id="script.js">script.js</h3>
            <p>With jQuery imported we can now grab the weather.gov json
            file holding the weather data from Harrison, NY with a
            simple line of code:</p>
            <pre><code>$.getJSON(url, grabMyData );</code></pre>
            <p>The dollar sign indicates we are using jQuery code. We
            run getJSON(), passing in the json file’s url and sending it
            to our grabMyData() function as input.</p>
            <p>Inside grabMyData() we are selecting the index file’s
            <em>the-forecast</em> div, and setting its inner text to a
            sun, cloud or !? depending on the current short weather
            forecast description value from our weather json data.</p>
            <p>And that is the most minimal possible example I can think
            of. Check out the json file for examples of many more facets
            of the weather API you can access.</p>
            <h2 id="rate-limiting">Rate Limiting</h2>
            <p>Companies with data APIs may restrict access to their
            data by requiring registration. If you make a commercial app
            that uses their live data, they may even charge a fee.
            Sometimes they may offer a free tier and a commercial tier.
            Weather.gov does not charge a fee, but they warn that they
            may limit access to intense users of their data:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>All of the information presented via the API is intended
            to be open data, free to use for any purpose. As a public
            service of the United States Government, we do not charge
            any fees for the usage of this service, although there are
            reasonable rate limits in place to prevent abuse and help
            ensure that everyone has access. The rate limit is not
            public information, but allows a generous amount for typical
            use. If the rate limit is execeed a request will return with
            an error, and may be retried after the limit clears
            (typically within 5 seconds). Proxies are more likely to
            reach the limit, whereas requests directly from clients are
            not likely.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Be careful to avoid rapid reloading.</p>

            <h2 id="homework-2-weeks">Homework (2 weeks)</h2>
            <p>For this assignment you are to make a unique weather
            “app” via accessing the US Government Weather API from the
            National Weather Service.</p>
            <p>See above for documentation of the API.</p>
            <p>Using our starter code in class and the json data file
            for Purchase, create a compelling weather program
            website/app.</p>
            <p>Pay attention to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>crafting a compelling visual representation of the
            data</li>
            <li>making it unique</li>
            <li>ensuring all code runs</li>
            <li>cleaning up the interface to be clear and bug-free</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Link to your weather program from your class website
            landing page.</p>
            <p>Upload the link to your finished program.</p>
