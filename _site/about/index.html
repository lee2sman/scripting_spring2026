            <p>Scripting For The Web is an upper level programming
            course designed to cohesively work with the web as
            technology, primarily through Javascript and its dynamic
            libraries and frameworks. We will build websites and web
            applications for clients and servers that use live data and
            interactivity as input, giving this work shape and form
            through code.</p>
            <p>This course is designed to be flexible to student
            learning goals and interests. The Web is an evolving
            platform and technology. We will be covering a large array
            of programming interfaces, languages, frameworks and
            applications including HTML, CSS, Javascript, the DOM,
            NodeJS, Express, APIs, markdown, Bash, Linux, Git. Our goal
            will be to treat the web as a space for exploration and as a
            platform we can shape and on which to build projects that we
            envision.</p>
            <p>Some of our learning will be difficult. Students will
            need to consistently write code and build websites and web
            applications multiple days a week throughout the semester in
            order to reinforce their learning and to complete their
            projects. In addition to our assignments, students are
            expected to do research out of class, to spend time
            debugging and solving coding errors and challenges, and to
            be bold and take charge of their learning.</p>
            <p>This class is in Math and Computer Science, cross-listed
            with New Media, and we will take an expansive view of the
            web as medium to manipulate through scripting. In addition
            to our technical work we will discuss topics relating to our
            use of this technology such as privacy, user experience,
            accessible design, open source culture, and abuses of social
            media.</p>
