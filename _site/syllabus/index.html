            <h1 id="course-description">Course Description</h1>
            <p>Scripting For The Web is an upper level programming
            course designed to cohesively work with the web as
            technology, primarily through Javascript and its dynamic
            libraries and frameworks. We will build websites and web
            applications for clients and servers that use live data and
            interactivity as input, giving this work shape and form
            through code.</p>
            <p>This course is designed to be flexible to student
            learning goals and interests. The Web is an evolving
            platform and technology. We will be covering a large array
            of programming interfaces, languages, frameworks and
            applications including HTML, CSS, Javascript, the DOM,
            NodeJS, Express, APIs, markdown, Bash, Linux, Git. Our goal
            will be to treat the web as a space for exploration and as a
            platform we can shape and on which to build projects that we
            envision.</p>
            <p>Some of our learning will be difficult. Students will
            need to consistently write code and build websites and web
            applications multiple days a week throughout the semester in
            order to reinforce their learning and to complete their
            projects. In addition to our assignments, students are
            expected to do research out of class, to spend time
            debugging and solving coding errors and challenges, and to
            be bold and take charge of their learning.</p>
            <p>This class is in Math and Computer Science, cross-listed
            with New Media, and we will take an expansive view of the
            web as medium to manipulate through scripting. In addition
            to our technical work we will discuss topics relating to our
            use of this technology such as privacy, user experience,
            accessible design, open source culture, and abuses of social
            media.</p>

            will be making so many websites in this class. You must have
            a good file structure and it is imperative that you back up
            your work!</li>

            <h3 id="academic-integrity-policy">Academic Integrity
            Policy</h3>
            <p>The Purchase College academic integrity policy explicitly
            forbids cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of academic
            dishonesty. Plagiarism is the appropriation or imitation of
            the language, ideas, and/or thoughts of another person and
            the representation of them as one’s own original work.
            Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with
            the definition of plagiarism and the acceptable methods of
            attribution. Violation of any of the above may lead to
            formal disciplinary action and the following sanctions:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Minimum Sanction: Failing grade on the assignment or
            examination. Maximum Sanction: Expulsion</li>
            <li>Recommended Sanction (First Offense): Failing grade for
            the course</li>
            <li>Recommended Sanction (Second Offense): Expulsion</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Students who have any questions or doubts about whether
            any activity is academically permissible should check with
            the instructor.</p>
            <h3
            id="chatgpt-and-large-language-models-llm-policy">ChatGPT
            and Large Language Models (LLM) Policy</h3>
            <p>The use of ChatGPT and other similar Large Language
            Models can be useful for writing code, but my own take is
            that the more you rely on it, the harder it is for a learner
            to learn how to code, how to think through blocks, and come
            up with innovative solutions. This is in addition to other
            issues relating to commercial LLMs like abuse of copyright,
            environmental impact, surveillance, false information,
            so-called ‘hallucinations’ and generic creative output.
            While I’ve seen it help some programmers in some
            circumstances I also see student learners usually get
            results they don’t understand how to use, and they
            copy/paste and turn in half-working code, that they don’t
            understand, that is overbuilt for industry solutions when
            they were so close to figuring out a simpler solution
            themselves that would have helped them with a more complete
            understanding, and the satisfaction of solving on their
            own.</p>
            <p>Here’s our rules:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Do not turn in code you don’t understand and
            have written line by line.</strong></li>
            <li>You can use LLM if you choose to do so, to
            <strong>explore topics, not to write your code for
            you</strong>. These are questions such as “What is a
            classless CSS stylesheet?” and “What are the tradeoffs of a
            locally-served font versus using a CDN?”</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="accessibility-statement">Accessibility
            Statement</h3>
            <p>The Office of Disability Resources collaborates directly
            with students who identify documented disabilities to create
            accommodation plans, including testing accommodations, in
            order for students to access course content and validly
            demonstrate learning. For those students who may require
            accommodations, please contact the Office of Disability

             Any repetitive or disruptive behavior, including but not
            limited to outbursts, intoxication/drug use, personal or
            physical threats, damage to property, etc., may result in
            the professor requesting the student to leave class,
            contacting University Police, and/or notifying the Office of
            Community Standards.</p>

            learning activities and small-group work.<br />

            <li>Additional unexcused absences may affect your
            grade.<br />
            </li>
            <li>Late arrivals or early departures may be counted as
            absences.<br />
            </li>
            <li><strong>If you are sick, don’t come to class. Get in
            touch with the professor.</strong></li>
            <li>If you miss class, it is your responsibility to find out
            from classmates what you missed and submit assignments on
            time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Learning programming is a cumulative effort. Each class
            builds on what you have learned in previous classes. Missing
            class can substantially set you back in this process.
            Therefore, it is important that you attend every class.</p>
            <p>Coding can be difficult, and struggling with the material
            is part of the learning process. Students are allowed to
            collaborate to learn from each other. Do not collaborate in
            order to simply find out a solution to a project. Each
            participant should contribute approximately equally, and
            what you turn in should be your own. Copying a solution from
            another student, even if you change a few minor things such
            as variable names, is not a collaboration. You may help
            someone learn something, but you can not tell them what to
            code. If you have questions about collaboration or academic
            integrity, get in touch with me via email, talk with me
            before or after class, or come to office hours.</p>
